I'm an India based software developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently working as a Development Lead at [Engro Technologies](https://www.engro.io/) and as a Freelancer doing an Website Development in WordPress & Magento on [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/u/pankaj91).

Outside work, I occasionally blog on [Sharing Info](https://www.sharinginfo.in/). Off-screen, I like to build Electorinic Projects!
