Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [K.T.H.M Collage](http://www.kthmcollege.ac.in/), after that I completed my Bachelors in Computer Application and Engineering in [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore](https://www.amrita.edu/) during 2021-2024 with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).
